# What is this?

This repository contains Prolog texts of the ProQuel Deductive
Database System from 1991. There were separate versions depending
on the database target, including a plain prolog target.

The Prolog texts were written for SICStus Prolog 0.x. The
Prolog texts contain also a linter and a cross referencer,
this was used to keep the code clean.
