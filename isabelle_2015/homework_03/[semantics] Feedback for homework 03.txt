Hello.

Sorry for sending the feedback again. We forgot to account for the bonus points on homework 3.2.

Effectively, your points for 3.1 doubled, and you got bonus points for 3.2.

The feedback to your homework is attached to this mail.
You will find our comments, including your score, enclosed in (** ... *)

Regards,
  Peter Lammich and Johannes Hoelzl
